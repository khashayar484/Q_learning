# Grid_world

This repository implements Q_learning, which is one of the branches of reinforcement learning in grid_world. Here you can set different rewards and punishes and start points in your grid, and you can see the result from other approaches.
for example if you start set environment(reward=12, reward_1=3, punish_2=15, start=0) in main function you can see this results.

or if you set environment(reward=0, punish_1=3, punish_2=12, start=15) result is:

## hyperparameters:
by changing and adjusting discount_reate, learning rate, exploration_decay_rate, max_exploration_rate result changes significantly
